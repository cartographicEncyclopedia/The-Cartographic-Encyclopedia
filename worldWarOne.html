            <p> The First World War began in 1914 when a young Serbian nationalist assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, triggering a series of declarations of war that involved the entire planet. After four years of fighting and as much as 20 million dead, the world would never be the same.

                    <p id="angloPortugueseAllianceStory">In 1369, England's long-time rival, France, allied with the Spanish Kingdom of Castille. This pushed England to ally with Castille's enemy, Portugal. Their alliance was made official and perpetual in the Treaty of Windsor, 1836. What's unique about the Anglo-Portuguese alliance is that it has continued to last up until the modern day, making it the oldest alliance in history.</p>

                    <p id="treatyOfLondonStory">In 1830, Belgium began a war for its independence from the Netherlands. After Belgium's victory, Great Britain brought the Great Powers of Europe together to redraw the borders of the nations in the interest of preserving the balance of power. In the 1839 Treaty of London, Belgium and Luxembourg were given independence from the Netherlands, and Great Britain promised to guarantee Belgian and Luxembourg independence in the event of an invasion.</p>
                    <p id="treatyOfLondonStory">Great Britain had a motive for fostering good relations with Belgium, as the Belgian port city of Antwerp was highly important for Britain's economic interests in this area.</p>

                    <p id="americaTiesStory">At the end of the 18th Century, The United States of America won its independence from Great Britain with the support of France. In the next century, despite another war with Great Britain, the U.S. would form very friendly relations with both these nations. As these two nations were the nations the U.S. had been interacting with the longest, strong economic connections bound their fates. Furthermore, the U.S., being composed in the majority by people of British descent, shared a similar culture with Great Britain. As both Great Britain and France implemented some form of republicanism, Americans saw Great Britain and France as considerably freer than authoritarian nations such as Germany and Russia. Thus, despite the U.S.'s ostensible isolationism, they were tied by good feelings and economic interests to Western Europe.</p>

                    <h3 id="dualAllianceStory">The Dual Alliance</h3>
                    <br id="dualAllianceStory">
                    <p id="dualAllianceStory">During the late 1860s and early 1870s, Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary were on friendly terms and known as the Three Emperors' League. However, these good feelings would not last. Following the War between Russia and the Ottoman Empire in 1877 - 1878, Austria-Hungary feared that Russia was becoming too powerful, industrialized, and aggressive. Russia was also highly supportive of the nationalist ambitions of the Slavic peoples in the Balkans, who could revolt against Austria-Hungary and bring in Russia as an ally. Austria-Hungary appealed to Germany, who held the Congress of Berlin to dictate the terms of Russia and the Ottoman's peace. In the Congress, German Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck supported giving Austria-Hungary more land and giving the Slavic states Russia had supported less land.</p>
                    <p id="dualAllianceStory">These events drew a wedge between Russia and the German nations. Rumors spread about how Russia might have made an alliance with France. In 1879, Germany and Austria-Hungary met to form the Dual Alliance. The treaty specified that Russia was the threat they would support each other against in the event of a war.</p>

                    <h3 id="tripleAllianceStory">The Triple Alliance</h3>
                    <br id="tripleAllianceStory">
                    <p id="tripleAllianceStory">As a conservative, nationalist nation that had recently unified, Italy had several similarities with Germany. Furthermore, it had ambitions of forming a powerful colonial empire, and had fears of a war with France. These factors pushed Italy to join the alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, the main term of which was to defend the other alliance members in the event of a war with France.</p>
                    <p id="tripleAllianceStory">By the end of the 1880s, German Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck was becoming increasingly aware of how Germany was making its rivals in Russia and France, and was concerned that this could lead to a global war. To prevent this, he made a Reinsurance Treaty with Russia to secure neutrality, and encouraged France and Britain's rivalry. This left Germany as the most powerful nation in Europe, with plenty of potential.</p>

                    <br id="tripleEntenteStory">
                    <p id="tripleEntenteStory">Great Britain had long been a rival of Russia, and had even longer been a rival of France. However, times were shifting. Great Britain was becoming increasingly liberal and sympathetic to the French. Most importantly, Great Britain was concerned about the threat of the powerful German Navy that was being built. In 1904, it entered into the Entente Cordiale with France, and in 1907, it entered into the Anglo-Russian Entente with Russia. Neither of these were official military alliances, but provided a basis for friendlier relations between Russia, France, and Britain, which were driven out of a concern of the German threat.</p>

                    <br id="francoRussianAllianceStory">
                    <p id="francoRussianAllianceStory">In 1890, Bismarck was dismissed, and the Reinsurance Treaty he made with Russia was not renewed. Over the next few years, the diplomatic situation he had set up to ensure Germany's power would slowly fall apart, and this was first seen in the Franco-Russian Alliance.</p>
                    <p id="francoRussianAllianceStory">Throughout the 1800s, numerous differences had separated France and Russia. France was a parliamentary republic that had wholly rejected its monarchy. Russia was an authoritarian power headed by a hereditary Tsar. In the past centuries, France had attempted to paint Russia as a backwards, medieval nation overcome with Eastern influences, and Russia had attempted to paint France as degenerate and unstable. France had Russia had met on opposite sides of the battlefield in both the Napoleonic and Crimean War in the past century.</p>
                    <p id="francoRussianAllianceStory">Despite these numerous differences, the 1870s provided France and Russia with a common enemy. In 1871, France lost its war to Prussia, resulting in Prussia uniting the German states into one empire and replacing France as the new dominant central European power. In 1878, Germany would support Austria-Hungary in a diplomatic conflict with Russia, and then go on to form an official alliance with Austria-Hungary on the basis of defending each other from Russian aggression. The leaders of Russia and France would realize that they shared an interest in defending themselves from Germany.</p>
                    <p id="francoRussianAllianceStory">What would commence was a dramatic change in Franco-Russian relations. Over the 1880s, the leaders of Russia and France would use propaganda to encourage their citizens to see the other nation in a better light. In 1892, Russia and France signed an agreement to protect each in the event of a war with Germany, Italy, or Austria-Hungary. The citizens of the Republic and the Autocracy, who had previously been so divided, now celebrated in the streets.</p>

                    <p id="balkanLeagueStory">The Balkan region was in the throes of Chaos. Greece, Romania, and the South Slav States of Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria all won their independence from the Ottomans with the support of the East Slav state, Russia. In 1912, the South Slav States and Greece formed the Balkan League and again went to war with the Ottomans to push the Ottomans out of Europe, only to fall apart as Bulgaria went to war with Serbia and Greece, which led to Romania and the Ottomans invading Bulgaria. In the end, Serbia, Greece, Montenegro, and Romania were all on good terms and supported by Russia, while Bulgaria and the Ottomans both nursed grudges. The South Slavs were a particular concern for Austria-Hungary, who feared that they would, with Russia’s support, attack in an attempt to free Slavic minorities within Austria-Hungary’s borders. </p>

                    <p id="naturalResourcesStory">The plentiful resources of the Balkans have always made the area valuable. In particular, the mountains of the Balkans have historically produced a great amount of precious metal and minerals. Mining and mineral processing has been an essential part of the Balkan economy for millenia. The true wealth of the Balkans, however, lies in its geographic position between Europe and Asia, with plentiful access to the seas, which makes the Balkans an essential part of much of world trade.</p>

                    <p id="religionStory">The Balkans geographic location has made the area a subject of fierce religious contest. On the nearby Italian Peninsula to the West stands The Vatican, the seat of Roman Catholic authority. For over a thousand years, Catholic Empires have attempted to conquer and Catholic missionaries have attempted to convert the Balkans. A couple times in history, the Balkans were entirely Catholic. However, in the eleventh century the Balkans would become the origins of Eastern Orthodoxy, a new sect of Christianity that would dominate much of the Balkans. Then, from the Anatolian Peninsula to the South, would come the Islamic Ottoman Empire, which would conquer the region and spread Islam to the Balkans. These three religions have been the subject of much conflict in the Balkans over the past several hundred years. In contrast to several other situations around the world, religion seems to have had a more decisive role than language in determining nationality in the Balkans.</p>

                    <p id="slavMigrationStory" class="description">For thousands of years, Slavic tribes lived along the rivers of modern-day Poland, Ukraine, and Russia. In the 500s and 600s, volcanic eruptions and meteorite strikes around the globe caused the ‘Late Antique Little Ice Age’, which brought the misery of cold weather upon northern Europe. At the same time, the Avars, a turkic people from central Asia, were moving West and pushing the Slavs out of the way. Meanwhile, in Southwestern Europe, the ‘Plague of Justinian’ devastated the population of the collapsing Roman Empire. The combination of these factors prompted many Slavs to invade southwards into the bountiful yet depopulated lands of the Balkan Peninsula, where they’d become the new dominant culture by 700 ad. For a period of time, the Romans subjected the Slavs to their authority, but the Slavs maintained a degree of autonomy until they gradually gained full independence. The Slavs who stayed behind would go on to form the modern states of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.</p>

                    <p id="bulgarMigrationStory" class="description">For hundreds of years, the Southeastern portion of the Balkans was predominantly populated by Thracians who were ruled by the Romans and were predominantly christian. The area was very rural and frequently invaded by nomadic tribes. As the South Slavs entered the area, they would displace or assimilate these Thracians, but over time would adopt their Christian religion. Around the same time, a group of turkic nomads called the Bulgars traveled from Western Asia to the Eastern Balkans, where they conquered the Slavs there. They would form a small ruling class over the Slavic majority, creating a notable culture divide between the Bulgarians and other slavic groups.</p>

                    <br id="balkansRomeStory">
                    <p id="balkansRomeStory">For hundreds of years, nearly the entirety of the Balkans south of the Danube river were dominated by the Romans and populated by romanized natives such as the Illyrians, Thracians, and Greeks. Roman economic infrastructure and standardized legal system turned the peninsula into a commercial powerhouse. By 330 AD, the Balkans and Anatolia had become the center of cosmopolitan prosperity and military security, and the capital moved to the city of Constantinople, at the southeastern most point of the Balkans. Not long after, the official religion of the empire became christianity. In 395, cultural differences and military security demanded the division of the Empire into two halves, with the majority of the Balkans making up an essential part of the Eastern Empire. Less than a hundred years later, the Western Empire would fall to Germanic raiders, but the Eastern Roman Empire, which was predominantly Greek, would remain for nearly a thousand years.</p>

                    <br id="theGreatSchismStory">
                    <p id="theGreatSchismStory">Despite the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the seat of Catholic Power continued to be the city of Rome, and the Pope would oversee the conversion of the Germanic barbarians who now dominated the former lands of the Western Empire. Over time, the Pope would become more and more heavily associated with the Western peoples. The Eastern Christians would often look upon with contempt and jealousy as the Pope would allow the West to change religious creeds and protocols. The East's dissatisfaction with the Pope's absolute authority, frequent miscommunications caused by the Latin-Greek language divide, and theological disputes over what type of bread should be used during sacrament, what words to say during a prayer, and the sanctity of religious icons would result in Pope Leo sending Cardinal Humbert to demand the Eastern Church's submission to Papal Authority in 1054. When Patriarch Cerularius of Constantinople refused, Cardinal Humbert would excommunicate him, and the Patriarch would respond by closing the Latin churches in the area. This event would send a great Schism in motion, which would be made irrevocable when Western Catholics crusading against Islam got involved in Eastern politics and ended up pillaging Constantinople in 1204.</p>

                    <p id="ottomanEmpireStory">In the 1000s, the Suljuk Empire, a nation of Turkic peoples who originated in the Asian Steppes and had been converted to Islam by an Iranian Empire, rose up in the East and conquered much of the Eastern Roman Empire's remaining territories in the Middle East. The Suljuk Empire would collapse, leaving behind dozens of small Turkic Beyliks (Kingdoms) who fought amongst each other, giving the Eastern Roman Empire a respite. However, the 1300s would see the rise of the Ottomans, which originated as a Beylik and would rise to unite the other Turkic tribes and conquer portions of the southern Balkans. In 1436, Sultan Mehmed II would conquer Constantinople, hammering in the last nail in the coffin of the ancient Roman Empire. Constantinople would later be renamed Istanbul and become the capital of the Ottoman Empire, which sought to create something like an Islamic Roman Empire. Over the next few centuries, the Ottomans would conquer the rest of the Balkans, the Middle East, and Northern Africa, becoming the dominant power in the region.</p>

                    <br id="balkansUnderOttomansStory">
                    <p id="balkansUnderOttomansStory">Ottoman domination would have a significant impact on the culture of the Balkans. The Balkaner upper classes were overthrown, social and political movements were halted, feudal systems were dismantled, and many material and human resources were destroyed by the Ottoman conquests. However, for a long period, the Balkans were more united and tranquil than any time since the decay of the Roman Empire, and the frequent Ottoman military victories brought celebration and security to the Balkans. The most dramatic effects were seen in religion. The Ottomans would not force conversion on the Balkans, but would promote Islam by taxing Muslims less, offering more social opportunities for Muslims, and investing in Islamic cities and infrastructure. Bosniaks and Albanians, two peoples who had never fully committed to either side in the Eastern Orthodox - Roman Catholicism schism, would willingly convert to Islam en masse. However, strong Orthodox communities would be kept alive in Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Romania, and strong Catholic communities would be kept alive in Croatia and Slovenia.</p>

                    <p id="russoTurkishWarStory">After witnessing the South Slavs failing to achieve independence from the Ottomans on their own, and the Ottoman Sultan's threat to annihilate the rebellious provinces, the Russians felt obligated to ensure the victory of their Slavic and Orthodox brethren. In 1877, they declared war on the Ottomans, and unleashed an unrelenting invasion through the Balkans and the Caucuses. They would be joined by rejuvenated rebellions in Romania, Armenia, and Serbia.</p>

The rapid advancement of industrialized technology and guns would leave more bodies on the battlefield than any of the last ten Russo-Turkish wars.

Serbia, Montenegro, and Romania were guaranteed complete independence. Bulgaria was put in the interesting situation of being ostensibly an autonomous Ottoman vassal, though in actuality had several military and economic obligations to the Russians while the Ottomans had no authority there. Bulgaria would gain full independence in 1908. Russia also imposed upon the Ottomans a demand to either pay over a billion rubles in reparations or hand over several northern territories. The treaty would have left Russia with unquestioned dominance over the Balkan and Black Sea region.</p>

The Serbs, Greeks and Bulgarians were feuding over who would control the territory of Macedonia, and the Ottomans were eager to make a comeback. Russian attempts to hold the alliance together failed. In June 1913, Bulgaria began attacking Serbia and Greece, tearing the Balkan League apart. While fierce fighting broke out which engaged the entirety of the Bulgarian border, Romania and the Ottomans invaded Bulgaria in an attempt to gain more territory. In the end, Bulgaria lost significant territory, Romania expanded, the Ottomans regained the province of Thrace, Bulgaria's relations with the other Balkan states and Russia were in shambles, and Austria-Hungary was ever more wary of the Slavic peoples.</p>

                    <p id="crossroadsStory">The Balkan Peninsula is situated right between Europe and the Middle East. History has seen several different peoples and cultures with origins that stretch from the Eastern Steppes of Asia to the Italian Peninsula, from Eastern Europe to the Arabian Peninsula, from Scandinavia to Northwestern India, and more have all had an influence on the make-up of the Balkans through migration and cultural diffusion. Many times in history a mighty empire has come and dominated the Balkans, only to fracture and leave the region more divided than ever before. The result is that the Balkans is one of the most diverse regions in the world, with so many contrasting religions, languages and ethnicities clamoring for territory and identity.</p>

As they settled in central Europe, they allied with the Romans and displaced and oppressed many Slavic people. Indeed, it’s sometimes believed that the word “slave” comes from the fact that the Avars took so many Slavs as slaves. They played a critical role in history as they influenced the Slavic migration into the Balkans, but their nationalist presence does not remain. In 796 ad they were defeated by the French, and over the next century either left Europe or assimilated with the local population.</p>

Philosophies of independence, fraternity, and liberty which had given rise to the French Revolution would permeate the Balkans with nationalism, especially among the Croatian and Slovenian peoples who lived in Illyria. The phrase 'Illyrian Movement' would describe the emerging notion of Pan-Slavism, the hope that the South Slavs might free themselves from foreign powers like the Ottomans, Austro-Hungarians, and French to form a united Slavic state.</p>

In the East, the Russians saw the Greek rebels as carrying the banner of Eastern Orthodoxy against Islam. In America and Western Europe, the Greeks were seen as the enlightened inheritors of the legendary nations of Athens, Sparta, and Rome, who were carrying the banner of Democracy against the autocratic sultan. Civilians across Europe and America volunteered to go fight on the side of the Greeks, and eventually Britain, France, and Russia officially joined the war. The Ottoman navy was almost entirely destroyed, and Greece won its independence in 1832.</p>

                    <p id="austriaHungaryStory">During the 1600s and 1700s, Austria had seen a spectacular rise to 'Great Power' status via successful wars against the Ottoman Empire. While the rest of their German states were united under Prussia, Austria did its own thing and conquered Magyars, Vlachs, Slavs, and Italians. However, by the 1800s, Austria's power was waning due to struggling in a series of wars against Napoleonic France, Italy, Prussian Germany, and Russia, as well as having to resolve the ethnic tensions within its own borders. More and more, the Austrians found themselves allying with their old rivals, the Ottomans, as a means to keep the Balkans stable and suppress Slavic nationalism. In 1867, it made concessions to its Magyar residents and became a Dual Monarchy, which changed the name to Austria-Hungary and granted autonomy to the Hungarian half of the country. However, the question remained of how to deal with its increasingly nationalistic Slavic population, as well as the threat of Russia.</p>

During the Ottoman Era, the people were divided, and gradually developed separate nationalities, but retained similar cultures. In 1876, the two worked together in an attempt to liberate themselves from the Ottoman Empire. They received some small support from the Russian Empire, another Slavic, Eastern Orthodox nation. The Russians attempted to avoid letting the war spiral out of control, but by the beginning of 1877, Serbia and Montenegro were giving up.</p>

                    <p id="congressOfBerlinStory">The Treaty of San Stefano scared the rest of Europe. Austria-Hungary worried that such a powerful Russia could roll over them if they came to war. More pressing was the issue that the Treaty of San Stefano promoted Slavic independence and Pan-Slavism, a sentiment that the Austro-Hungarians feared could spread into her own borders and encourage a revolution amongst the Croats and Slovenes. Britain had long supported the Ottoman's a way to enforce the balance of power in Europe, and now was anxious that Russia's powerful presence in the Black Sea could endanger Britain's interest in the Suez Canal and its passage to India.</p>
                    <br id="congressOfBerlinStory">
                    <p id="congressOfBerlinStory">To address these concerns and maintain the balance of power, the most influential politician of the age, German Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck, called for the Great Powers to meet in Berlin and redo the Treaty of San Stefano.</p>
                    <br id="congressOfBerlinStory">
                    <p id="congressOfBerlinStory">It was decided that Britain should occupy the island of Cyprus, giving it more influence in the Mediterranean. It was decided that Austria-Hungary should annex the provinces of Bosnia & Herzegovina, to weaken pan-Slavism. It was decided that Russia, Serbia, and Montenegro's territorial demands should not be as great as they had been in the original treaty. It was decided that the new Bulgarian state should not be as expansive.</p>
                    <br id="congressOfBerlinStory">
                    <p id="congressOfBerlinStory">In the end, Russia came out very dissatisfied with the new arrangement. Bismarck had attempted to be impartial and maintain Germany's cordial relations with both Russia and Austria-Hungary, but the Russians saw this as disregarding all the resources Russia had sacrificed in the war whilst caving to the demands of Austria-Hungary, who had sacrificed nothing. This led to the deterioration of Russian-German relations, while drawing Germany and Austria-Hungary closer together. Furthermore, Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia stewed resentment amongst the Serbs and Montegrins who had hoped to annex that province into a united pan-slavic state.</p>

With Russia's encouragement, Montenegro, Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria formed the 'Balkan League'. In October of 1912, the Balkan League and the Ottomans went to a war over control of the Balkans. It seemed to be a resounding success. The Greek Navy completely outmatched the Ottoman Navy, and the Balkan League's armies won battle after battle against the un-reinforced Ottoman armies. With the War's conclusion, Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria all significantly expanded their territories, a new Albanian state was formed, and the Ottoman's hold on Europe was reduced to the city of Istanbul. However, the Balkan League was not as united as it seemed…</p>
