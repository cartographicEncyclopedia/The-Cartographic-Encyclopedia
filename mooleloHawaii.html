                <h3> Mo'olelo Hawai'i</h3>
                <p>The mo'olelo (legends, myths, history) of Hawai'i goes back centuries. We are indebted to the work of 19th century Hawaiian historians such as Samuel Kamakau and David Malo who did immeasurable work to write down, analyze, and preserve the oral history of these islands.
                    <br>This website begins its presentation of the mo'olelo with Kalaunui'ohua, the Hawai'i chief who was the first one to come close to uniting the islands. It ends over four hundred years later, when Kamehameha finally realizes Kalauni'ohua's dream.
                    <br>Note that among the many sources on Hawaiian history, there are several contradictions. One source says that Oma'o was 'Umi's uncle, one source says that Oma'o was 'Umi's adopted son. One source says that Lono left his rule to study the martial arts and later returned and ruled alongside his wife, one source says that he left after he murdered his wife and was driven insane by the guilt. In such cases, the creator of this site has chosen to present only one timeline, so as to give a clear narrative.

                <p id="liloaText">
                    Liloa, the son of Kiha, devoted himself to peace and religion. As Ali‘i of Hawai‘i island, he built many Heiaus (temples), and dedicated the Sacred Slab of Liloa in the land of Waipi‘o, a famous stone that only Liloa and his descendants were allowed to stand upon. He married Pinea, a royal woman from Oahu, and they had one son, Hakau.<br>
                    One day, after celebrating the construction of a new Heiau, Liloa wandered off into the woods and met a common woman named Akahi. Liloa was smitten by Akahi and had a child with her. Before he left, he gave Akahi his feathered cape and a few other tokens, so that if the child should ever come looking for their father, they would know where to go.</p>

Akahi's husband, thinking 'Umi was his own son, was often angered by this behavior and would beat 'Umi. One day, Akahi was so indignified that her husband, a common man, should beat the son of a chief that she revealed whose 'Umi's father really was. Her husband wallowed in guilt, while 'Umi became determined to meet his true father. Akahi gave him the feathered cape and other tokens, and told 'Umi to go to Liloa's dwelling in Waipi'o valley.</p>

When they engaged in footraces, surfing competitions, or fake battles, ‘Umi, Ko‘i, and Pi‘i would often beat Hakau and his friends. Hakau would become increasingly distrustful of ‘Umi.

However, as the years passed, Hakau grew mad. He disregarded the Kahunas, punished commoners who weren't guilty of any wrongdoing, and abused the priests.
                    He also mistreated 'Umi more and more. 'Umi was not allowed to eat in the same room as Hakau, he wasn't allowed to use the same surfboard as Hakau, and he wasn't allowed to wear the same clothes as Hakau. 'Umi eventually became so fed up that he, Oma'o, Pi'i, and Ko'i left Waipi'o. They traveled through the mountain passes until they reached a small village called Waipunalei.

                    While the story of 'Umi's disappearance became famous around the island, 'Umi and his friends decided to hide in the small village of Waipunalei. They got wives and jobs. 'Umi worked as a fisherman for several years, and would often sacrifice fish to his god, Ku-ka'ili-moku.
                    After several years, an old Kahuna named Kaleioku saw that rainbows often decorated the sky whenever 'Umi fished. After performing a ritual, he concluded that 'Umi must be the long lost son of the old Ali'i, Liloa.
                    Kaleioku revealed 'Umi's identity to the village, and they decided to make him their chief. 'Umi set out to do his best as a ruler. He built several longhouses to serve as eating halls, and there he distributed food to the old, the sick, the young, the poor, and the travelers. His hospitality and generosity became famous across the island, and many would travel across the island to eat with 'Umi.

                <p id="umiVsHakauText">
                    Two of Hakau's old advisors, Nunu and Kahole, heard of the generosity of 'Umi. They had often been disappointed in Hakau's behavior, and Kaleioku invited them to seek out this 'Umi. When they arrived in Waipunalei, 'Umi presented himself as a servant and prepared their food. While they were eating, Kaleioku arrived and told them who the "servant" really was. Nunu and Kahole were so impressed with the humility and hospitality of 'Umi that they decided he should become the new Ali'i over the island.
                </p>
                <p id="umiVsHakauText">
                    Nunu and Kahole returned to Waipi'o and told their plan to the other elders. During the season of the god Ku, the elders told Hakau and his chiefs that they should go up Mauka to perform a ritual for Ku. There, a group of commoners came bearing gifts and sacrifices for Ku. This group suddenly cast away the gifts and revealed themselves to be led by 'Umi, and were carrying weapons, with which they murdered Hakau and his chiefs.

'Umi proved himself to be strong, capable, and handsome, and was able to marry the daughter of Kulukula'a. After he broke the princess's necklace, he was imprisoned and had to send Pi'i to run back to Waipi'o and fetch an even more valuable ivory necklace. Upon presenting this new necklace to Kulukula'a, 'Umi was freed and returned to Hamakua. There, he called his armies together and said that they would need to make war upon Kulukula'a in order to retrieve the valuable ivory necklace. They did so, were victorious, killed Kulukula'a, retrieved the necklace, and united Hamakua and Hilo once again.

                <p id="umiVsImaikalaniText">
                    The most formidable of 'Umi's rivals was Imaikalani, chief of Ka'u. Imaikalani was an aged veteran of many wars, and was a master of fighting with spears in each hand. After 'Umi's first attempts to conquer Ka'u were unsuccessful, 'Umi traveled alone through the mountains, where he convinced Chief 'Ehu of Kona to make war upon Ka'u. However, though he was blinded in this war, Imaikalani successfully defended himself against both 'Ehu and 'Umi.
                </p>
                <p id="umiVsImaikalaniText">
                    'Umi had hoped Imaikalani's blindness would weaken the chief and resumed his war on Ka'u, but Imaikalani retained his mastery of the spear. The war would continue for much longer, with no end in sight.
                </p>
                <p id="umiVsImaikalaniText">
                    Pi'i was determined to win the war for 'Umi, and so he studied the way Imaikalani would fight. He noticed that ducks would fly above the blind warrior, and would call out whenever a man approached him. Imaikalani would strike in the direction of wherever the duck called, and the approaching man would die. Pi'i accordingly struck down the ducks first, then Imaikalani's guards. With no one to help him, Imaikalani was at last slain by Pi'i.

He built Heiaus and celebrated religion, and he prohibited murder and thievery. He worked alongside the common people, fishing and building taro patches.

                    Kalauni'ohua was the Ali‘i of Hawai‘i island long ago, in the 1200s or 1300s. He was a relatively non-superstitious chief who disregarded prophets, priests, and omen-readers.
                    As a chief, he held absolute authority over Hawai‘i island, and grew ambitious for more. He desired to become the supreme ruler over all the islands.

                    Keli'ikaloa, son of 'Umi, became the ruler of the northwestern part of Hawai'i island, and his younger brother Keawe-nui became ruler of the southeastern part. Keawe-nui was known as a kindly chief who cared for the commoners. He was a patron of experts, and famous omen-readers, debaters, war leaders, chefs, perfume-makers, canoe-builders, and cloth makers came to live in his kingdom. Keli'iokaloa was known as a pious and religious ruler, but failed to care for his people. He seized the food, livestock, and property of the commoners.
                </p>
                <p id="keliiokeaweConflictText">
                    When Keawe-nui heard of how cruelly his brother treated the commoners, he decided he should conquer Keli'iokaloa's kingdom. He gathered his armies and marched through the mountains, breaking through Keli'iokaloa's initial defenses while his fleet of canoes sailed around the island. The fleet and the armies reached the coast of Kona at the same time, and they eviscerated Keli'iokaloa.

They advised Kanaloa to attack 'Umi and steal the wealth of Kona, and Kanaloa assented. The invasion of Kona went well, 'Umi was killed, and Kanaloa became the wealthy chief of both Kohala and Kona.

One day, while he and Kaikilani were playing konane (Hawaiian checkers), some mischief-makers hid in the foliage and called out to Kaikilani, pretending to be her lover. Lono, convinced his wife was disloyal, became so furious that he beat Kaikilani to death.

                    Lono took hold of these duties with a renewed vigor. He upheld the peace, he listened to his counselors, and he patronized warriors, artists, chefs, soothsayers, and paddlers. At a certain point, he gained a desire to travel the islands and celebrate the world.

                <h3 id="waimeaBattleText"><strong>The Battle of Waimea</strong></h3>
                <p id="waimeaBattleText">
                    When it was heard that Kama had attacked Kanaloa, Lono gathered his forces from Ka'u and allied with the chiefs of Kona to repudiate the warlord of Maui. They went north and forced the armies of Maui onto the dry, grassy plain of Waimea, where they had no water and became dehydrated.
                </p>
                <p id="waimeaBattleText">
                    The battle began with a duel between Lono's heir, Puapuakea, and Kama's heir, Maka-kuikulani. The two had argued long ago when Puapua-kea visited Maui. Maka struck Puapua across the head with his club, and Puapua crumpled. Believing his adversary dead, Maka strutted off, only for Puapua to stand and slay the unexpecting Maka.
                </p>
                <p id="waimeaBattleText">
                    With that, the armies on both sides moved against each other. With spears and stones flying across the battlefield, many died on both sides, but the forces of Maui were at a disadvantage without water. Eventually, they began to flee, and some of them, including Kama's son, Kauhi, made it back to Maui. Kama, however, was determined to fight without showing fear. His courage was lauded, but futile as he died on the plain of Waimea.
                </p>
                <p id="waimeaBattleText">
                    With that, Kama was defeated, and peace was returned to Hawai'i. Kauhi would become the new Ali'i of Maui. Kanaloa's son, Keakealanikane, would become the new chief of Kohala.

                <p id="hiloWarsText">
                    Keakamahana and the chiefs of Kona coveted the lands of Hilo, which was rich in bird feathers and canoes, while the chiefs of Hilo coveted Kona for its plentiful drinking water and fishing spots. This tension came to a head when Keakamahana had the chief of Hilo, Kua'ana, captured and tortured. Kua'ana barely escaped, and joined his son, Kuahu'ia in making war upon Kona.
                </p>
                <p id="hiloWarsText">
                    The wars between Hilo and Kona lasted many, many years, and were filled with bloody fighting and political backstabbing. Unfortunately, the chaos of this era means that the sources on it contradict many times, so it's hard to say what really happened.

                <p id="hiloWarsText">
                    The Hilo chiefs were more successful in the war, though the chiefs of Kona won a battle every once in a while. Keakamahana was captured by Hilo, and then returned to her rule a couple years later. Kua'ana passed his rule on to Kuahu'ia, who passed the rule on to Kalanikukuala'ala'a and Moku, and they all carried the war against Kona. Keakamahana passed on, and she gave the rule to her daughter Keakealani, who continued the war on Hilo.

                <p id="hiloWarsText">
                    In the battle of Mahiki, Kalanikukuala'ala'a and Moku were joined by Chief Konakaiale'e of Kaua'i. There they inflicted a devastating defeat upon Kona, and killed most of the chiefs.

                    After the death of Keakealani, her son Keawe set out to return dignity and security to Hawai'i. He married into the 'I family, finally bringing peace between Hilo and Kona. Through some deft political maneuvering, he managed to be recognized as the sovereign of the entire Hawai'i island, though some autonomy was still given to the Hilo chiefs.

Keawe traveled to other islands, building himself a reputation of an energetic and courageous Ali'i. He became so famous that to this day Hawai'i island is sometimes called Moku o Keawe (Island of Keawe).

Still, Kanahaokalani managed to slow down the war and delay until his ally would arrive.

                <p id="peleioholaniInterventionText">
                    When Alapa'i arrived on Oahu, messengers were sent to Kanahaokalani's uncle, the legendary Chief of Kaua'i and Ni'ihau, Peleioholani. Peleioholani immediately brought his fleet to Oahu to save his nephew. With Peleioholani's support, the forces of Oahu and Hawai'i were evenly matched and Alapa'i was forced to reconsider his war strategy.
                </p>
                <p id="peleioholaniInterventionText">
                    At some point, a wise kahuna named Na'ili brought Alapa'i and Peleioholani together for a peace conference. Na'ili showed that there was some relation between the two chiefs, and that fighting was not worth it. The two chiefs accepted Na'ili's return, and Alapa'i left Oahu. However, Peleioholani remained on Oahu. A year later, Kanahaokalani died, possibly by murder, and Peleioholani became the Ali'i of Oahu as well as Kaua'i and Ni'ihau.

                    After he had secured control over Hawai'i, Kalaniopu'u grew bored of the peace and began looking for some opportunity to go to war. Kamehamehanui, the Chief of Maui, was the brother of Kalaniopu'u's favored wife, Kalola, but the Ali'i of Hawai'i did not care for this relationship. He gathered his chiefs, soldiers, and canoes, and they sailed to Hana where they began pillaging the land. The war saw intense fighting and much bloodshed over several years as Kamehamehanui tried to hold off Kalaniopu'u. Eventually, Kamehamehanui gave up and Kalaniopu'u was able to gain control of the Ka'uiki Hill fortress and the region of Hana…

Annoyed, Kahekili and his foster son Kahahana attacked Ke'eaumoku. After a fierce battle, Ke'eaumoku would flee to Moloka'i, but Kahekili would pursue him. Ke'eaumoku was forced to flee again, this time escaping to Hana, where he found shelter with Mahihelelima.

For this reason, Kahekili nursed a grudge against his foster son for years.

                    Though Kahekili faced an early defeat, he was committed to the defense of his island. When Kalaniopu'u ordered some of his best soldiers to hunt Kahekili down, Kahekili led these soldiers into the barren sand dunes of Kahulu'u. Here, Kahekili's general was waiting with reinforcements. Kahekili's general famously proclaimed, "The fish have entered the sluice; draw in the net," before leading his armies down the dunes, raising up a torrent of sand to obscure the air, and crushing the army of Hawai'i.
                </p>
                <p id="kahekiliStrikesBackText">
                    Kahekili then endeavored to eliminate Kalaniopu'u. Joined by his foster son and ally, Kahahana of Oahu, he attacked Wailuku.
                </p>
                <p id="kahekiliStrikesBackText">
                    Completely surrounded, Kalaniopu'u began to fear for his life. His cousins, the twins Kame'eiamoku and Kamanawa, had a plan to save Hawai'i. They brought Kalaniopu'u's son, who was the nephew of Kahekili, Kiwala'o to the presence of Kahekili. Kahekili was so overcome by affection for his nephew that he agreed to a peace deal. Kalaniopu'u pretended to be amicable and returned to Hawai'i.

                    Kalaniopu'u now had a fierce grudge against Kahekili, and after a short peace he returned to Maui and pillaged Ko'olau again. And, again, Kahekili and Kahahana fought him off. Kalaniopu'u fled to Kaho'olawe, and then to Lana'i where he pillaged the land. While in Lana'i, his soldiers were forced to sustain themselves off of a strange root plant, which came them digestive problems. This war was thus down for generations to the people of Lana'i as the war of "The War of the Loose Bowels".

                <p id="kalaniopuuStrikesBackAgainText">
                    Kalaniopu'u returned to Ko'olau. Yet again, Kahekili came to fight him off. However, this time, Mahihelelima came to Kalaniopu'u and agreed to become a vassal of Hawai'i. With a base in Hana, Kalaniopu'u was able to continue to wage his war against Kahekili, with more success than before. The war would continue to last many more years.

                <h3 id="cookLandsWaimeaText"><strong>Captain James Cook Lands in Waimea</strong></h3>
                <p id="cookLandsWaimeaText">
                    In January of 1778, the British ships HMS Resolution and HMS Discovery, captained by James Cook and Charles Clerke respectively, landed at Waimea, Kaua'i. Hundreds of fascinated Kanaka came to see the foreigners, with their plentiful iron nails and firearms. It is said that Cook and Clerke met with Ka'eokulani and Kamakahelei, and the Ali'i presented the captains with hogs, chickens, bananas, taro, and fine mats, and the captains presented the Ali'i with cloth, a sword, necklaces, and mirrors. Cook and Clerke would sail between Kaua'i and Ni'ihau for two weeks before leaving the islands and going on to America.
                </p>
                <p id="cookLandsWaimeaText">
                    The news of James Cook's arrival would spread across the islands. This would spark a contentious debate over whether James Cook was an incarnation of the god Lono. When Cook first landed, a Kaua'i priest named Ku'ohu proclaimed that Cook fit the old prophecies which foretold that the god Lono would return from the west. The first Kanaka who boarded the Resolution thought that the pipes the sailors were smoking were indicators that the foreigners could breathe fire, and that a bullock's hide was the remains of Kulongdog, a beast from Hawaiian mythology. However, the longer Cook stayed, the less the people of Kaua'i were convinced that he was a god. Ka'eokulani, for one, dismissed the theory entirely due to the fact that many of the foreigners, Cook included, were seduced by Kaua'i women.
                </p>
                <p id="cookLandsWaimeaText">
                    Nevertheless, as the news spread and descriptions of the event became more and more exaggerated, those who had not actually seen Cook in person began to believe that Lono really had returned. Kalaniopu'u, for one, was entirely convinced, and announced, "Life is ours! The God of our ancestors has returned!"
                </p>
                <p id="cookLandsWaimeaText">
                    The coming of Cook also brought the first western disease to Hawai'i: Syphilis, which would begin to damage the Hawaiian population.

                <p id="cookSecondComingText">
                    In November of 1778, Cook and Clerke returned to the islands, where they sailed off the coast of Maui. Both Kalaniopu'u and Kahekili, who were at war, gathered together their retinues and got canoes and sailed out to board the HMS Resolution. Kalaniopu'u, a believer that Cook was Lono, was especially deferential to the foreign captain. Kamehameha managed to spend a night aboard the Resolution, getting to know the sailors. After a couple of days, the foreigners decided to sail to Hawai'i island.

                <p id="cookSecondComingText">
                    Cook would go on to Hawai'i island, and he would travel around the island, trading guns and iron for hogs, taro, leis, capes, and tapa cloths. He arrived in the Makahiki season of festivals and goodwill, and many people on Hawai'i island believed Cook to be the god Lono, and, in one instance, they took him to a heiau and gave him religious offerings.

                    In January of 1779, Kalaniopu'u decided that Cook was more interesting than Maui, and so he made a truce with Kahekili and returned to Hawai'i so he could observe the foreigners. As a believer in Cook's divinity, he was very hospitable to the crews of the Resolution and Discovery.

                <p id="cookDeathText">
                    Cook and Clerke set out to leave Hawai'i in February of 1779. However, as they were leaving, they noticed that the wood of their mast was decaying, and were forced to return. By now, though, many Hawaiians had grown annoyed with how long the foreigners had been staying, and more and more were growing disillusioned with the theory that the foreigners were gods because of how frequently the sailors slept with the Hawaiian women.
                </p>
                <p id="cookDeathText">
                    There is some confusion as to what happened next. Some say that Cook ordered his sailors to take some wood from a Hawaiian burial ground to use to repair the mast. Some say that a man named Palea, intent on proving whether or not the foreigners were gods, attempted to aggravate a sailor, and in response, was beaten with a club. Whatever the case, many Hawaiians ended up angry at the foreigners and stole a small cutter boat from the Discovery.
                </p>
                <p id="cookDeathText">
                    In order to find the boat, Cook decided to abduct Kalaniopu'u and question the chief. Kekuhaupi'o  and another chief, named Kalimu, attempted to see what was happening and Kalimu was shot and killed. Kekuhaupi'o accordingly gathered a mob to come to the rescue of Kalaniopu'u. The mob met James Cook on the beach and slew him.
                </p>
                <p id="cookDeathText">
                    After this, Charles Clerke took control of the expedition. He would hastily leave Hawai'i, sail to Kaua'i to get new supplies, and leave the islands. Kalaniopu'u ordered that James Cook should receive an honorable burial.

                    Kalaniopu'u, now over 80 years old, would spend the remainder of his reign in relative peace. He lived in Kona, and he would delight in watching hula dance performances.

                <p id="kalaniopuuLastDaysText">
                    At some point, Imakakoloa, chief of Puna, and Nu'u, chief of Ka'u, began plotting to rebel against Kalaniopu'u with the support of Kahekili. Kalaniopu'u defeated them with subterfuge; he tricked Nu'u to go out surfing on a day the kahunas predicted sharks would be out, and the chief of Ka'u was eaten. Kalaniopu'u then captured Imakakoloa.

                <p id="kalaniopuuLastDaysText">
                    It was intended that Kalaniopu'u's heir, Kiwala'o would sacrifice Imakakoloa. However, in the middle of the ceremony, Kiwala'o's cousin, Kamehameha, stole Imakakoloa's body and made the sacrifice himself. For this reason, many of the chiefs predicted that Kamehameha would one day overthrow Kiwala'o.

                    Not long after Imakakoloa's rebellion, Kalaniopu'u died of an illness. Rule over Hawai'i island passed on to his son, Kiwala'o. His nephew, Kamehameha, who had shown himself to be a master in the subjects of war and religion, was made the guardian of the war god, Kuka'ilimoku, and governor of Waipi'o a land that had been considered sacred since the time of Liloa.

                    Meanwhile, Kahekili saw the death of Kalaniopu'u as an opportunity to regain control of Hana. Mahi attempted to defend the land, but Kahekili dammed the streams that flowed to Hana and the defenders began dying of thirst. Kahekili accordingly marched in with ease and slaughtered any who opposed him.

                <p id="kamehamehaIndependenceText">
                    Immediately after the death of Kalaniopu'u, there were three factions vying for influence over the young Ali'i Kiwala'o. The Kona chiefs, the Hilo chiefs, and the Ka'u chiefs all wanted more land for themselves. The famed warrior Kekuhaupi'o used his influence to encourage the Kona chiefs to rally around Kamehameha, and said that Kamehameha should be given control of the northwestern part of the island. Kiwala'o wanted to give Kamehameha something, but he was anxious and indecisive and yielded authority to his uncle, Keawemauhili. Keawemauhili carved out large pieces of land for himself and his friends, the Hilo chiefs, and refused to give any land to Kamehameha.
                </p>
                <p id="kamehamehaIndependenceText">
                    Kiwala'o's half-brother, Keoua, who was a chief of Ka'u was very frustrated that the Ka'u faction had not received much land in the redistricting, and went to Kiwala'o to complain. Kiwala'o defended Keawemauhili, though, and so Keoua was forced to vent his frustrations elsewhere. He gathered a few of his men and they traveled to Kona, slew a few men, and brought back their bodies. Instead of reprimanding his half-brother, Kiwala'o sacrificed the bodies of these men. Kamehameha and the Kona chiefs were outraged, and raised their arms in rebellion. The four most prominent chiefs who supported Kamehameha were Ke'eaumoku, Kamanawa, Kame'eiamoku and Keawe-a-heulu, who were sometimes referred to as his "Four Kona Uncles". Kiwala'o, meanwhile, was supported by the forces of Keoua and Keawemauhili.

                <p id="kamehamehaIndependenceText">
                    After four days of small skirmishes, the two sides met in full force at Honaunau. Unfortunately for Kamehameha, many of the lesser chiefs and people of Kona deserted him, believing Kiwala'o to be the rightful heir to Kalaniopu'u. Kamehameha thus lost the battle, and he and the forces of Kona were forced to retreat to Ke'ei.

                    Keawemauhili was captured alive, but his captors were sympathetic to him because he was a famous, noble chief who had a long history of fighting for Hawai'i. They let him escape, and he made his way to Hilo where he set up his own kingdom.

                <h3 id="struggleForHawaiiText"><strong>The Struggle for Hawai'i</strong></h3>
                <p id="struggleForHawaiiText">
                    With Kamehameha in Kona, Keoua in Ka'u, and Keawemauhili in Hilo, Hawai'i was in a precarious position.
                </p>
                <p id="struggleForHawaiiText">
                    Meanwhile, Kahekili, Chief of Maui, was continuing to nurse his desire to conquer Oahu and thought that one of the three Hawai'i chiefs must be eager for an ally. In need of a fleet to invade Oahu, he sent messengers to Kamehameha asking for a few canoes. Kamehameha refused, claiming he needed every canoe he had to defend himself. Keawemauhili, though, heard of these messengers, and, on his own volition, sent Kahekili a gift of beautiful war canoes. Kahekili was so grateful that he sent a small army, led by the general Kahahawai, to support Keawemauhili. Keawemauhili made an alliance with Kahekili and Keoua, and was intent on getting his revenge against Kamehameha.
                </p>
                <p id="struggleForHawaiiText">
                    Kamehameha attempted preempt Keawemauhili's scheming by invading Ka'u. The invasion was a disaster. Keoua, with the support of Kahahawai, handily defeated Kamehameha. Kamehameha's beloved mentor, Kekuhaupi'o, was killed, and Kamehameha and Ke'eaumoku fled by sea.
                </p>
                <p id="struggleForHawaiiText">
                    Kamehameha's boat washed up somewhere along the coast of Hilo. He happened upon a family fishing and, believing them to be Keawemauhili's people, attempted to attack and kill them. He tripped on a rock, and the fisherman struck him over the head with a paddle, but spared his life. This incident would be known as the story of the Splintered Paddle.
                </p>
                <p id="struggleForHawaiiText">
                    Later, Keawemauhili came and drove Kamehameha out of Hilo. After Kahahawai returned to Maui, Kamehameha attempted to fight his rivals again and again, but each time he was defeated and the war drew out into a stalemate. Kamehameha began studying his defeats and refining his tactics.
                </p>
                <p id="struggleForHawaiiText">
                    Also around this time, Kamehameha married Ka'ahumanu, the daughter of Ke'eaumoku.

                    Kahekili, the Chief of Maui, had long been jealous of his foster son, Kahahana, who ruled the land of Oahu with its beautiful cliffs and plentiful taro fields. In order to build up his fleet, he made an alliance with Keawemauhili and Keoua of Hawai'i, who sent him plenty of Hawai'i's finest war canoes. One notable chief who was originally from Hawaii and fought alongside Kahekili was Ka'iana.

Kahahana was unable to unite his lesser chiefs and warriors, and the defense of Oahu was scattered and easily picked off. Kahahana went into hiding in the wilderness for a year, before finally being turned in by his half-brother and sacrificed by his foster father.

                <p id="voyageOfKaianaText">
                    In the late 1780s, the first Europeans since the death of James Cook came to visit Kaua'i and Oahu. One of these was Captain John Meares and the ship <i>Nootka</i>. Ka'iana, who by now had some feud with Ka'eo and wanted to get away, convinced Meares to let him join the crew of the <i>Nootka</i>.
                </p>
                <p id="voyageOfKaianaText">
                    The <i>Nootka</i> took Ka‘iana on a spectacular voyage. Their first stop was Macao, China, the marketplace of the world. There were English, Chinese, Scandinavian, German, American, Italian, Filipino, and other traders from around the world. There are stories that Ka‘iana was fascinated by Catholic Mass and would attend and copy the worshippers, that he was overjoyed by a portrait made of him, that he found two rabbits and excitedly copied their mannerisms, that he often encouraged his English friends to donate liberally to the many beggars on the streets of Macao. When he left, his many friends sent him away with many gifts, such as cattle, rabbits, oranges, mangoes and other plants. In this time, Ka‘iana also gained a better understanding of English and trade, and, crucially, he learned the formula for gunpowder.

                    After leaving Macao, they traveled through the Philippines and Melanesia, and Ka’iana had the opportunity to meet several other Polynesian peoples. He also saw the devastating impacts of disease, as an illness broke out on the <i>Nootka</i>.

                <p id="voyageOfKaianaText">
                    Ka‘iana then traveled up to Northwestern America, where he got to meet Russian traders and several native Alaskan tribes. The English Captain Douglas named a place they landed in “Tianna’s Bay” in the honor Ka‘iana (Tianna being an earlier transliteration of Ka‘iana’s name). Though the name didn’t stick, it was perhaps the first foreign place named after a Hawaiian. Ka‘iana was not a fan of the cold up north, and covered himself in layers.

                    These journeys of Ka‘iana became known around the world, and he was undoubtedly the most famous Hawaiian alive at the time.

                <p id="struggleForMauiText">
                    When Kahekili left Maui to go attack Oahu, there was much unrest on Maui. Kamehameha's brother, Kalanimalokuloku, saw this as an opportunity and invaded Maui, conquering Hana.

                <p id="struggleForMauiText">
                    Kalanikupule, the son of Kahekili, gathered his forces and set out to reassert control of Maui. Kalanikupule was known as a humble chief who would fraternize with the common people, and he was able to quiet the unrest. Along with his general, Kamohomoho, he fought and defeated Kalanimalokuloku, who fled back to Hawai'i. Kamehameha, though, vowed he and his brother would return to Maui, and that they would be the ultimate victors.

                <h3 id="davisYoungText"><strong>Isaac Davis and John Young</strong></h3>
                <p id="davisYoungText">
                    In 1790, a boat called the Eleanor, captained by Simon Metcalfe, sailed to Hawai'i. While in Kona, he met the chief Kame'eiamoku, and had the chief whipped over some infraction. He then sailed on to Maui. There, he and his crew traded away guns and ammunition in exchange for hogs and vegetables with the people of Maui.
                </p>
                <p id="davisYoungText">
                    One night, a man named Ka‘opuiki endeavored to steal a small cutter boat from the Eleanor. He rowed out, killed the watchmen, and stole the cutter in order to tear it apart for wood and iron. When the crew of the Eleanor woke up the next day, they realized their man had been slain and their ship stolen, and they were furious.
                </p>
                <p id="davisYoungText">
                    A few days later, the Eleanor came by Oluwalu, and Metcalfe invited the people of Maui to come and trade with him. However, as the trading canoes approached the Eleanor, Metcalfe ordered his crew to open fire. It was a terrible, unprecedented carnage. Canoes were shattered, the Kanaka traders were slaughtered. It is said that the brains of the victims shot through the head leaked out into the ocean. The families of the traders crowded the beach, crying and mourning over the dead.
                </p>
                <p id="davisYoungText">
                    The Eleanor then sailed back to Hawai‘i island as Simon Metcalfe intended to convene with his son, Thomas Metcalfe, the captain of the Fair American. While he was waiting, one of his men, John Young, went ashore to explore the island. He did not return, though, for he was captured in the dark by Kamehameha.
                </p>
                <p id="davisYoungText">
                    At the time, Thomas Metcalfe was sailing the Fair American along the shore of Hawai‘i, on his way to meet his father. However, he stopped to trade in the land of Kame‘eiamoku.
                </p>
                <p id="davisYoungText">
                    Kame‘eiamoku had nursed a grudge after he was whipped by Simon Metcalfe, and had heard of the tragedy inflicted at Oluwalu, and now had a prejudice against foreigners. When the Fair American came to trade, Kame‘eiamoku and his men attacked, killing Thomas Metcalfe and the rest of the small crew except one man, Issac Davis.
                </p>
                <p id="davisYoungText">
                    When neither his son or John Young came, Simon Metcalfe sailed away.
                </p>
                <p id="davisYoungText">
                    John Young, Isaac Davis, and the contents of the Fair American were brought in front of Kamehameha. Kamehameha was delighted with this opportunity. He befriended the two men and gave them wives and land. He had the two men show him and his soldiers how to fire and aim guns. Among the contents of the Fair American was a great cannon the Hawaiians would name “Lopaka”, and John Young was placed in charge of operating it.
                </p>
                <p id="davisYoungText">
                    With these two foreigners to serve him and the most expansive arsenal of the chiefs, Kamehameha knew he had amazing potential.

                <p id="kamehamehaVsKalanikupuleText">
                    Kamehameha convinced Keawemauhili that, with his new arsenal of weapons, he was the most powerful Chief of Hawai'i. Keawemauhili accepted and agreed to break his allegiance with Keoua and Kahekili, and instead ally with Kamehameha, and so he sent Kamehameha a supply of canoes and soldiers to use in a war for Maui.
                </p>
                <p id="kamehamehaVsKalanikupuleText">
                    Kamehameha then gathered his host of men, canoes, and guns and set out to Maui, where he warred with the chief Kalanikupule, son of Kahekili. After a few small battles, the two sides met in full force at Wailuku. It was a great, terrible clash fought with guns and spears, it lasted two days and saw much death on both sides. The Maui warriors were fierce, and in the olden days might have won, but these were not the olden days. John Young and the forces of Hawai'i set up the cannon Lopaka and shot volley after volley until Kalanikupule's men were scattered. Kalanikupule and his general Kamohomoho narrowly escaped back to Oahu, and Kamehameha won control over Maui.
                </p>
                <p id="kamehamehaVsKalanikupuleText">
                    Kamehameha then sailed over to Moloka'i, where Kalola, the half-sister of Kahekili and the widow of Kalaniopu'u, was living. Kamehameha promised to give land riches to the daughter of Kalola, and, in return, Kalola gave Kamehameha Moloka'i after her death.

                <h3 id="keouaStrikesText"><strong>Keoua Strikes</strong></h3>
                <p id="keouaStrikesText">
                    Keoua was afraid. Kamehameha had formed an alliance with Keawemauhili and had conquered Maui with such ease. Keoua would have to act fast, before Kamehameha returned.
                </p>
                <p id="keouaStrikesText">
                    And so Keoua struck against Keawemauhili, the old Chief who fought in Alapa‘i’s wars against Peleioholani, who fought against Alapa‘i in Kalaniopu‘u’s rebellion, who fought against Kamehamehanui and Kahekili of Maui, who fought for Kiwala‘o, who became the independent ruler of Hilo, who fought against Kamehameha before allying with him. Keoua killed Keawemauhili, and conquered Hilo. He then moved on to Kohala, and ravaged the taro farms and slaughtered the commoners, intent on conquering the land before Kamehameha returned. He was too slow. Kamehameha returned to Kohala, and a great battle was fought.
                </p>
                <p id="keouaStrikesText">
                    However, despite the fact that Kamehameha had a much larger supply of weapons, Keoua was able to hold his ground. His soldiers fought bravely against the guns and cannons, and the battle was a draw.
                </p>
                <p id="keouaStrikesText">
                    Keoua did have one remarkable instance of bad luck. As he was returning to Ka‘u, a volcano he was passing erupted and killed much of his army. Keoua only narrowly escaped.
                </p>
                <p id="keouaStrikesText">
                    After this, there were many skirmishes between Kamehameha and Keoua, but neither side was able to secure victory. One thing they did was spread propaganda against each other. They sent their wise kahunas and genealogical experts throughout the land, and these experts would recite the ancestry of their respective chiefs, attempting to portray either Kamehameha or Keoua as not pure royalty.

                <p id="kaianaReturnsText">
                    Around this time, the famed traveler Ka'iana would return to the islands. He was dropped off at Hawai'i island, and Kamehameha, immediately recognizing the value of a chief skilled in the foreign ways, offered Ka'iana some land and convinced the chief to join his entourage. This paid off, as Ka'iana immediately negotiated with his friend Captain Douglas to secure a supply of swivel guns, muskets, and ammunition. Ka'iana also provided Kamehameha with the formula for gunpowder. Douglas would then go to Kaua'i and back, bringing Ka'iana's brother Namakeha and the rest of his family to Hawai'i island, and on the way he would sell some guns to Kahekili.
                </p>
                <p id="kaianaReturnsText">
                    Over the next few years, Ka'iana would be a crucial asset of Kamehameha, as he negotiated with Europeans to supply more and more arms and ammunitions, provided Kamehameha the formula for gunpowder, and would train his fellow chiefs and soldiers in how to use firearms.
                </p>
                <p id="kaianaReturnsText">
                    Kamehameha would send Ka'iana and Namakeha south to fight against Keoua, but they did not have much success. Keoua had mastered defensive warfare, and repeatedly held off the armies sent by Kamehameha.

                <p id="vengeanceKaeoKahekiliText">
                    While Kamehameha was trying without much success to defeat Keoua, trouble was brewing. When, Ka'eokulani, the chief of Kaua'i, heard of how swiftly Kamehameha had conquered Kaua'i, and how bloody the Battle of Wailuku was, he was greatly disturbed and recognized the threat Kamehameha posed to the rest of the islands.
                </p>
                <p id="vengeanceKaeoKahekiliText">
                    Ka‘eokulani was a mighty powerful chief in his own right. Like Kamehameha, he had great success trading with foreigners, and had a large supply of muskets and other weapons. He had a servant foreigner of his own, named Mare Amara, who operated a cannon.
                </p>
                <img class="textImages" id="kaeoImage" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kBbmQK-drRZspdrkWhsEAb4eq-K2BL4V">

                <p id="vengeanceKaeoKahekiliText">
                    He thus formed an alliance with his half brother, Kahekili. Kamakahelei was left to rule Kaua‘i, Kalanikupule was left to rule Oahu, and Ka’eo and Kahekili set out to put an end to the threat that was Kamehameha. With ease, they reconquered Moloka‘i and Maui. Most of this land was returned to Kahekili’s chiefs, though Waiehu on Maui was given to Kaua‘i.
                </p>
                <p id="vengeanceKaeoKahekiliText">
                    In preparation for the upcoming invasion of Hawai’i, Ka‘eo climbed upon the fortress of Ka‘uiki and struck his spear East in the direction of Hawai‘i. He gave the following speech to his followers: “O you of Kauai! Chiefs, soldiers, warriors, and dear little ones, be strong, be brave! Drink the water of Waipi‘o and eat the taro of Kuaka!”
                </p>
                <p id="vengeanceKaeoKahekiliText">
                    Ka‘eo and Kahekili then set sail and began their invasion of Hawai‘i. Ka‘eo and the soldiers of Kaua‘i made their way to the sacred land of Waipi‘o. There, they destroyed everything. They set fire to the heiaus, they shattered the tabus, they broke the Sacred Slab of Liloa, they uprooted the taro farms, they slaughtered the commoners. The most holy spot on Hawai‘i island was utterly overthrown.
                </p>
                <p id="vengeanceKaeoKahekiliText">
                    Kamehameha hastily gathered his warriors, many of whom were caught up fighting Keoua, and brought them to fight off the invaders. The forces of Hawai‘i, Kaua‘i, Oahu, and Maui all met in a great naval clash known as Kepuwaha‘ula. It was a fierce, famous, and bloody fight.
                </p>
                <p id="vengeanceKaeoKahekiliText">
                    Kamehameha, John Young, and Isaac Davis sailed upon the <i>Fair American</i>, and Ka‘eo and Kahekili swarmed them with canoes. Young and Amara fired cannon volley after volley at each other.
                </p>
                <p id="vengeanceKaeoKahekiliText">
                    In the end, neither side emerged victorious, and Kahekili and Ka‘eo returned to Oahu. Still, Kamehameha and his forces were badly damaged and the destruction of Waipi‘o was devastating for them.

                <p id="deathOfKeouaText">
                    After the devastating war with Ka'eo and a long, bloody stalemate against Keoua, Kamehameha would turn to his gods for help. He called his soldiers home and began the construction of a great heiau in Pu'ukohola. He himself took a part in its construction, carrying the heaviest stones upon his back. Once the stones were laid, he erected a great shelter of 'ohi'a wood to house his God, Kuka'ilimoku.
                </p>
                <p id="deathOfKeouaText">
                    Not long after, the chiefs Keawe-a-heulu and Kamanawa, who were skilled at persuasive and deceptive speech, traveled to Ka'u to speak to their nephew, Keoua. They said they were here to bring Keoua to Kamehameha, so at long last a peace could be made. Keoua and his advisors did not entirely believe Keawe and Kamanawa's stories, but Keoua was tired of all the fighting and wanted to trust his uncles. He thus consented to go with them.
                </p>
                <p id="deathOfKeouaText">
                    On the journey to Kona, Keoua became increasingly sure he was to die, but he faced his death nobly. When he reached Kamehameha's camp, he boldly proclaimed "Here I am!" and attacked Ke'eaumoku before being shot down by musket fire. His body was sacrificed up the Pu'ukohola Heiau.
                </p>
                <p id="deathOfKeouaText">
                    After this Kamehameha took control of Ka'u, Puna, and Hilo, uniting Hawai'i island once more.

                <h3 id="vancouverPeaceText"><strong>Captain George Vancouver and Attempts at Peace</strong></h3>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceText">
                    George Vancouver first came to Hawai'i in 1778 as a midshipman in Captain Cook's crew. After that fateful voyage, he gradually rose through the ranks of the British Navy.
                </p>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceText">
                    In 1792, Vancouver led his own voyage to return to Hawai‘i. He sailed along Kona and found many Hawaiians eager to trade. He refused them all, though, when he found they wanted one thing from him: guns. His philosophy was that he should encourage peace wherever he went, and he refused to deal arms that would be used in war.
                </p>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceText">
                    On Hawai‘i island, he met two chiefs, Ka‘iana and Ke‘eaumoku. Vancouver had heard of the exploits of Ka‘iana, but he had little fondness for the worldly chief who he felt had a treacherous demeanor and was scheming to attack his crew and seize his ships and guns. He also saw Ka‘iana as responsible for bringing in many of the guns which had been used with such violence to the islands. He noted with disappointment that many of the Hawaiians were, after only a few years with firearms, as skilled at fighting with the guns as European soldiers thanks to Ka‘iana’s training. Vancouver appreciated Ke‘eaumoku, though, who treated him with hospitality and told him the recent history of Hawaiian politics and Kamehameha’s rise.
                </p>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceText">
                    Vancouver then made his way to Kaua‘i, and on the way he noted how the population of the islands seemed to have plummeted since when he first came on Cook’s journey due to foreign diseases and the constant warfare. He also notes that the Kanaka had become much more distrustful of foreigners since Cook’s visit due to the frequent conflicts that had arisen, such as the Oluwalu Massacre. Most Kanaka were also disinterested in trading with him once they realized he wasn’t selling guns.
                </p>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceText">
                    On Kaua‘i, Vancouver met with the young prince Ka‘umuali‘i, son of Kamakahelei and Ka‘eokulani. Vancouver left a very positive impression on the young Kaumuali‘i, who appreciated the captain's peaceful philosophies. Inspired by Vancouver, Kaumuali‘i would endeavor to learn the English language later in life. Vancouver also set off fireworks in Waimea, to the amazement of the people of Kaua‘i.
                </p>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceText">
                    Vancouver returned again to Hawai‘i in 1793, and Ke’eaumoku brought him before Kamehameha and John Young. Vancouver first met Kamehameha with Cook’s crew in 1779, and found the Chief to have changed since then. Vancouver wrote of Kamehameha, “... his riper years had softened that stern ferocity which his younger days had exhibited, and had changed his general deportment to an address characteristic of an open, cheerful, and sensible mind; combined with great generosity, and goodness of disposition.” Vancouver’s meeting with Kamehameha went exceedingly well, as Vancouver was very impressed by the leadership abilities of Kamehameha and his people, as well as the party's lavish gifts. Kamehameha showed his goodwill to Vancouver when a Hawaiian woman stole an axe and some other items from Vancouver's ship and Kamehameha had the items returned. One day, Kamehameha had his soldiers perform a sham battle for Vancouver. It was a great mock fight with some soldiers pretending to be the forces of Kahekili and Ka‘eo attacking Hawai‘i. Vancouver was greatly impressed by the creativity of the strategies the mock battlers used, and that night he showed Hawai‘i a brilliant fireworks show.
                </p>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceText">
                    Once Vancouver had established friendly relations with the many chiefs, he waged a campaign to convince the chiefs to end their constant warfare lest they continue to decimate the population. Kamehameha was open to the idea of a peace conference with Kahekili and Ka‘eo, but he demanded that he be given control of Maui, and Vancouver knew that Kahekili would never agree to those terms. Kamehameha was also eager to make an alliance with King George of England, and asked that Vancouver bring a gift of a yellow cape to the king, to which the Captain accepted. Vancouver would also try to convert Kamehameha to christianity, but found that the Ali'i was profoundly devoted to the old gods of Hawai‘i.
                </p>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceText">
                    Vancouver then went on to Maui, where he noted that land was absolutely devastated by the years of constant war. He met with Kahekili, who by now was ancient and wrinkled, and who seemed impoverished compared to Kamehameha and without many gifts for Vancouver, but that “his countenance, though furrowed by his years and irregularities, still preserved marks of his having been, in his juvenile days, a man of pleasing and cheerful manners, with a considerable degree of sensibility, which the iron hand of time had not yet entirely obliterated.” Vancouver discussed the idea of peace with Kahekili, and Kahekili agreed that a lasting peace would be a blessing, but that he could not trust Kamehameha to hold it.
                </p>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceText">
                    Ka‘eo then came to Maui and greeted Vancouver warmly. The Chief of Kaua‘i revealed that he had met and befriended Vancouver 14 years ago when Vancouver came with Cook’s crew, and showed that he had kept a lock of Vancouver’s hair after all this time. Vancouver was embarrassed that he had not remembered Ka‘eo and wrote very fondly of the passion and affection of the Kaua‘i chief. Ka‘eo was very open to the idea of a peace conference, and asked Vancouver to return Hawai‘i and continue negotiating with Kamehameha. Unfortunately, Vancouver was still required to go on to Oahu and Kauai and then was required to return to America, but he promised to return in a year and bring Ka‘eo and Kamehameha together.
                </p>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceText">
                    Vancouver then went on to Oahu, where he met with Kalanikupule. He gave Kalanikupule medicine for an illness the chief was dealing with and provided another fireworks show, and continued to spread his message of peace. Again, Kalanikupule was open to peace but skeptical the other chiefs would keep it. Vancouver moved on to Kaua‘i, where he once again met with Kaumuali‘i before leaving the islands once more, intent on returning in one year.

                    Not long after Vancouver left, Ali'i Kahekili of Oahu, Moloka'i, and Maui gave his last breath. He was a man famous for his cruelty to his enemies, but also for his unwavering faith in the gods, adherence to order, and skill in warfare. Upon his death, his son Kalanikupule became Chief of Oahu, and his half-brother Ka'eokulani, the Chief of Kaua'i, also became ruler of Maui and Moloka'i.

                <h3 id="vancouverPeaceAgainText"><strong>Vancouver and Peace, Again</strong></h3>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceAgainText">
                    In 1794, George Vancouver again returned to Hawai'i and met with Kamehameha. Again, their visit was full of cordiality, and Vancouver had a new plan to bring peace. He endeavored to make all of Hawai'i a protectorate of the British Empire, both to keep the peace and protect Hawai'i from other foreign empires, while maintaining the sovereignty and culture of the Hawaiian government. Kamehameha called his subordinate chiefs together to debate the idea. Ke'eaumoku and Keaweaheulu were in favor, but Ka'iana was suspicious about Vancouver's intent. Nevertheless, Kamehameha accepted Vancouver's treaty and proclaimed that the Kanaka of Hawai'i were now the Kanaka of Britain.
                </p>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceAgainText">
                    Vancouver moved on to Maui and Oahu, intent on getting the rest of the islands to join the protectorate. However, for unknown reasons, he was not able to get in contact with Ka'eo or Kalanikupule. For this reason, a lasting peace for Hawai'i was not achieved. Furthermore, the treaty was not ratified in Britain, and Kamehameha stopped considering Hawai'i an official part of Britain after some time.
                </p>
                <p id="vancouverPeaceAgainText">
                    However, Kamehameha would continue to have good relations with Britain, and Britain's relationship with Hawai'i was a reason no European power would try to conquer Hawai'i for many years.

                    Ka'eo ruled over Maui for a year with kindness and intent to rehabilitate the land after its destruction in the wars. Still, he grew homesick for Kaua'i and his old friends, and set out to return. When Kalanikupule heard Ka'eo was sailing west, he feared it was to conquer Oahu, and he began preparing for battle. When Ka'eo stopped on Oahu, Kalanikupule attacked, but the two sides realized the confusion and made peace quickly.
                </p>
                <p id="kaeoVsKalanikupuleText">
                    However, as Ka'eo was preparing to resume his voyage to Kaua'i, he heard that there was a conspiracy to have him murdered. Realizing that he would rather die in glorious battle among friends, he decided to attack Kalanikupule and make a war. He secured early victories, and Kalanikupule was forced to retreat.
                </p>
                <p id="kaeoVsKalanikupuleText">
                    However, soon after the war began, a group of ships known as the Butterworth Squadron landed on Oahu. Kalanikupule immediately reached out, offering Captain William Brown 400 hogs in exchange for his support in the war. Brown agreed.
                </p>
                <p id="kaeoVsKalanikupuleText">
                    The great clash came on December 12th, 1974, at the Battle of 'Ewa. Kalanikupule's men commanded the high ground, Brown's men held the shoreline, and Ka'eo was surrounded. The Chief of Kaua'i got what he wanted: He died fighting bravely.

                <p id="kaeoVsKalanikupuleText">
                    Around this time, Kamakahelei also passed, and the young Kaumuali'i became the new ruler of Kaua'i.

                    Kalanikupule's relationship with Captain William Brown quickly soured. Brown demanded more hogs than their initial agreement specified, and so Kalanikupule and his advisors conspired to kill Brown. After they killed Brown, they seized control of the Butterworth Squadron and its crew. Kalanikupule's general, Kamohomoho, warned Kalanikupule that these men would not be loyal to the man who killed their captain, but Kalanikupule was feeling very confident in himself after defeating Ka'eo and Brown, and wanted to take the Butterworth Squadron east and conquer Kamehameha, thus uniting the islands. However, the Butterworth Squadron immediately mutinied against him and sailed away, and on their way east they gave a large amount of their guns to Kamehameha and encouraged him to take the fight to Kalanikupule.

                <p id="kalanikupuleVsKamehamehaText">
                    Kamehameha had perhaps been swayed by Vancouver’s arguments for peace, but this was too good of an opportunity, and he had reason to believe that Kalanikupule would not leave him in peace, so he gathered his canoes and armies for war. He sailed west, conquering Maui and Moloka‘i swiftly, before reaching Oahu.

                <p id="kalanikupuleVsKamehamehaText">
                    In preparation for the invasion of Oahu, Kamehameha called his war leaders together to plan out their attack. Ka‘iana, who was disliked by the other chiefs for contrarianism and scheming, was excluded from these meetings, and the great explorer feared they were planning to have him killed. He accordingly fled to Oahu with some men and joined the forces of Kalanikupule.

                <p id="kalanikupuleVsKamehamehaText">
                    Kamehameha then began his invasion, and the two sides clashed at the great Battle of Nu‘uanu. Cannons and guns fired, spears and stones were flung. John Young slew Ka‘iana with a blast from Lopaka. In the end, Kalanikupule’s forces were scattered by the superior numbers and guns of Hawai‘i, and the son of Kahekili fled to the underbrush. He lived in hiding for a year before being caught, and his body was sacrificed to Kuka‘ilimoku.

                    While Kamehameha was attempting to conquer Kaua'i, Namakeha, a chief of Ka'u who had been the brother of Ka'iana, raised his arms in rebellion. Kamehameha immediately returned to Hawai'i and defeated Namakeha. This would be the last battle Kamehameha fought. For the next few years, he would turn his attention away from war and on to governing.

                <p id="reignOfKamehamehaText">
                    Now that the islands were at peace, Kamehameha set to making himself not just a good warrior, but a good governor.
                </p>
                <p id="reignOfKamehamehaText">
                    He awarded his most loyal followers, Ke'eaumoku, Keawe-a-heulu, Kame'eiamoku, and Kamanawa, with large pieces of land.
                </p>
                <p id="reignOfKamehamehaText">
                    He brought forward many experts to form a great council to advise him in promoting general welfare. He famously found the man who, many years ago in Hilo, struck him over the head with a paddle. For the man's act of mercy in sparing him, Kamehameha proclaimed the Law of the Broken Paddle, which protected the common people from wanton violence. He prohibited murder, thievery, making it possible for "old men and women and children to sleep in safety by the wayside." He promoted the fishermen, the carpenters, the farmers, the weavers, and all manner of craftsmen. He built many heiaus and offered many sacrifices for his gods. He held no grudges and was always patient. He was known to adopt the children of commoners and train them to be warriors or leaders, and he would often go out with the commoners to labor alongside them.
                </p>
                <p id="reignOfKamehamehaText">
                    Kamehameha created several policies to prevent the chiefs from rebelling against him. He enforced a monopoly on trade, having all trade between the lesser chiefs and foreigners go through him so no chief became too wealthy. He would go out at night and disguise himself, listening to see if his chiefs were plotting against him. He appointed unambitious commoners to be governors, so that they would not rebel.
                </p>
                <p id="reignOfKamehamehaText">
                    Because of all this, Kamehameha was very popular, and the peace and prosperity helped the islands heal from the constant wars.
                </p>
                <p id="reignOfKamehamehaText">
                    In this time, the twins Kamanawa and Kame'eiamoku, two of Kamehameha's "four Kona uncles", likely passed away.

                <p id="anotherFailedInvasionText">
                    Still, Kamehameha had one ambition now that the Kingdom of Hawai'i was running smoothly: The conquest of Kaua'i. The unification of the islands had not been so near at hand since the days of Kalaunuiohua. And so, Kamehameha prepared for a fantastic invasion. He built the greatest fleet of canoes Hawai'i had ever seen, and gathered all his armies. Nothing could stop them. But then, disaster struck.
                </p>
                <p id="anotherFailedInvasionText">
                    A great and terrible disease, likely cholera, blazed through the army. Almost all who contracted it would die quickly. It is said that their corpse would turn black. Ke'eaumoku and Keawe-a-heulu, along with much of Kamehameha's mighty army, contracted the disease and died. Kamehameha stood by the bedside of Ke'eaumoku, his father-in-law and oldest ally, and wept for hours. Kamehameha himself contracted the disease, and only narrowly survived.

                <p id="submissionOfKauaiText">
                    Kamehameha continued to nurse his ambition to unite the islands, but he resolved to do it by diplomatic means. In 1810, he sent Isaac Davis to Kaua'i to convince Chief Ka'umuali'i to come to Oahu for a conference. Davis and Ka'umuali'i liked each other, and Davis was impressed by the young Chief's English skills, and Ka'umuali'i agreed to meet with Kamehameha.
                </p>
                <p id="submissionOfKauaiText">
                    Ka'umuali'i was perhaps considering his old conversations with Captain Vancouver, who implored him to peace, and Kamehameha was perhaps considering the old story of how Kukona spared the life of Kalaunuiohua. The two came to agreement: Kamehameha would become the nominal King of all the Hawaiian islands, but Ka'umuali'i would maintain the autonomy of Kaua'i. This deal finally united the Hawaiian islands.
                </p>
                <p id="submissionOfKauaiText">
                    Some of the lesser Hawai'i chiefs were unhappy, though, and conspired to have Ka'umuali'i poisoned. Isaac Davis learned of this scheme and implored Ka'umuali'i to return to Kaua'i. Unfortunately, the schemers poisoned Davis instead.
                </p>
                <p id="submissionOfKauaiText">
                    Regardless, Kamehameha, at long last, was the undisputed King of Hawai'i.

                    For perhaps the first time since some lost myth of antiquity, the Hawaiian islands were united under one King: Kamehameha. The King would take steps to ensure the stability of his domain: He kept the commoners and lesser chiefs happy, he named his son Liholiho as successor, and he formed an alliance with Great Britain and would give Hawai'i a flag inspired by the British one. History is a testament to his success: After his death, Hawai'i would never again break into several warring states again.

                <p id="theKingText">
                    Kamehameha would spend the last of days fishing, worshipping, and governing. He would die in Kona, surrounded by priests, chiefs, and family in 1819. All the islands mourned his passing.
